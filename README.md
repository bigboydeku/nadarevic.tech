# Denis' Portfolio 
Ever since the pandemic began, I've worked on my web development skills by working on side projects and at work. I am proud to say that I've gained quite a few skills over this time, including how to prototype, optimize, and efficiently develop applications. 

This portfolio aims to showcase some work that I will add onto over time.
